# movie-rec-tags
Content-based movie recommender system using MovieLens tags

## Python Libraries Used:

* warnings
* re
* PIL
* wordcloud
* pandas
* numpy
* umap
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* gensim
* nltk

## Environment YAML File

I included a conda YAML file for you to create the environment I used with all the libraries installed:

```bash
conda env create -f env_movie_rec_tags.yml
```

## Motivation for the Project

I wanted to see if I can build a simple but reasonable content-based movie recommender system with only MovieLens tags. There are three key business questions that I answer along the way which are critical to building this recommender system.

## Files

* Movie-Rec-Movielens-Tags.ipynb

  * Jupyterlab notebook with all the code used in the analysis

* env_movie_rec_tags.yml
